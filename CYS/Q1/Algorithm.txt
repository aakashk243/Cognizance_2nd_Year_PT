ALGORITHM : 
1.The decryption uses AES Algorithm
2.The AES Algorithm requires a secret key for decryption of the given cipher.
3.Convert The given Morse Code into Secret Key
4.The Secret key is of 16 characters.So the Algorithm is AES-128 which has 10 rounds for decryption.
5.Now use the cipher and select the algorithm for decryption and give the secret key.
