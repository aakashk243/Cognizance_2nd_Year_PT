ALGORITHM : 
1.The decryption uses AES Algorithm
2.The AES Algorithm requires a secret key for decryption of the given cipher.
3.Convert The given Morse Code into Secret Key
4.The Secret key is of 16 characters.So the Algorithm is AES-128 which has 10 rounds for decryption.
5.Now use the cipher and select the algorithm for decryption and give the secret key.

HOW ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STAMDARD ALGORITHM WORKS : 
ENCRYPTION :-
1.THE DATA IS TAKEN IN MATRI OF BYTES
2.THE STEPS INCLUDE SUBSTITUTION OF BYTES,MIXXING OF ROWS AND COLUMNS AND FINALLY ADDING THE KEY AFTER EACH ROUND
3.IN THE SUBSTITUTION OF BYTES IS DONE WITH THE HELP OF A TABLE CALLED THE S-BOX.REPEATION OF USED BYTES DOES NOT OCCUR
4.THE ROWS ARE SHIFTED THE NUMBER OF TIMES AS THEIR INDEX
5.THE COLUMNS ARE SHIFTED BY MULTIPLYING THE MATRIX BY ANOTHER MATRICES
6.THE COLUMNS ARE XOR-ED STARTING FROM FIRST COLUMN
DECRYPTION :-
1.THE STEPS PERFORMED IN THE ENCRYPTION IS DONE IN THE REVERSE ORDER
2.FIRST THE ROUND KEY PROCESS IS DONE MEANING THE THE COLUMNS WILL BE XOR-ED FROM THE REVERSE ORDER
3.NEXT THE MATRIX ARE MULTIPLIED BY SOME INDEPENDENT MATRICES SO THAT WE WILL GET THE ORIGINAL MATRIX ORDER
4.FINALLY FORM THE S-BOX THE RESPECTIVE BYTES ARE CHANGED AND THE ORIGINAL MATRIX COMES WHICH IS OUR ORIGINAL DATA STORES IN FORM OF BYTES IN A MATRIX
